# Hi there! 👋 I'm Darren

I'm a **PhD student** at the [Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri) interested in **Learning Health Systems, Complexity, and Tech**. My work spans from developing tools to streamline evidence synthesis and understanding how best to design health systems that can take on the emergent behaviour learning. ie: [Learning Health Systems]([url](https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-023-01095-2))

In a previous life I was a Biomedical Engineer, but now wear multiple hats as a data analyst, implementation scientist, and someone who "generally tries to be useful at all times."

## 🔬 Research Focus

I split my time between:
- **Developing and evaluating tools** to streamline evidence synthesis during evidence-based guideline development
- **Understanding how best to implement Learning Health Systems** as a framework for healthcare improvement

My work bridges computational methods, implementation science, and a sprinkling of complex systems. The end goal here is pragmatic tools and approaches to better integrate evidence into practice. 

I maintain the computational stuff here.
